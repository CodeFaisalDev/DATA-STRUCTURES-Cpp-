# DATA-STRUCTURES-Cpp-

A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be efficiently accessed and manipulated. It provides a systematic way to organize and manage data, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, retrieval, and modification operations.

Data structures can be classified into two main categories: primitive data structures and abstract data structures.

          1. Primitive Data Structures: These are basic data structures built into most programming languages, such as integers, floating-              point numbers, characters, and booleans. They represent the fundamental building blocks for constructing more complex data                  structures.

          2. Abstract Data Structures (ADS): These are higher-level data structures that are implemented using primitive data types. They                provide a logical representation of data and define the operations that can be performed on that data. Examples of abstract                data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.

Each data structure has its own characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. The choice of a data structure depends on the specific requirements of an application, including the type of operations to be performed, the efficiency requirements, and the constraints of the problem being solved.

Data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science and play a crucial role in algorithm design and optimization. By selecting and using appropriate data structures, programmers can improve the efficiency and performance of their programs.
